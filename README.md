# deep-learning

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
the purpose of this challenge was to process, train and optimize the model so that we could correctly predict the result of non profits. 
Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
the target was to reach that 75 percent accuracy.
What variable(s) are the features for your model?

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
